## DNN Install Package

With each new release of **DNN_Tailwind**, we create a **DNN Install Package** for the out-of-box theme that **DNN_Tailwind** produces. This is a highly optimized theme that can be used by anyone. These install packages can be downloaded from [HERE](https://github.com/skrantzman/DNN_Tailwind/releases). The install package (ZIP file) will follow the following naming convention:

```
DNN_Tailwind_<version>_Install.zip
```

Once you have the ZIP file downloaded, you may install it into the desired DNN instance in the same manner you install other themes, via the **Extensions** page.

### Important Note:

Since the purpose of **DNN_Tailwind** is more for development of custom themes, you wouldn't want to attempt to tweak the **Install Package** in order to create your custom theme. Instead, you will want to:

- [Get your local development environment up and running](./Installation)
- [Setup your custom project](./Project-Setup)
- [Utilize the commands that are built-in the DNN_Tailwind framework](./Commands)
